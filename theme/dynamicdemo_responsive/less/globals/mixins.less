 * Mixins are functions that look like CSS classes.
 * e.g. a mixin is defined like:
 *
 * 		.im-a-mixin{...}
 *
 * they can have parameters passed to them like this:
 *
 * 		.im-a-mixin(@im-a-parameter:im-the-default-value){...}
 *
 * You don't have to use this file but it can be useful for repeatable
 * styles on buttons etc.
