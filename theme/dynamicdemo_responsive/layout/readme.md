Layout folder
=============

If everything on the login is laid out how you like alread... Ignore this folder! :D

Before copying anything from theme/dynamicbase/layout try doing what you
want to achiev through the renderer.

if its not possible, copy the layout file you want to override into here. you
can then make your changes and should see them appearing.
